            <p>This is a project created for The Odin Project's 
                Node.js course to build an API server and two 
                front-end websites (this one and an Admin Dashboard) 
                to make requests to the API endpoints to view and 
                manage blog posts, comments, and users.</p>
            <p>The server is built with Node.js and Express, and both front-end sites in React.</p>
